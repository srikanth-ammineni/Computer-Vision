# Computer Vision projects

## Panorama image stitiching
- The objective of this project is to stitch two images together to construct a panorama image

## Image Filtering & Template Matching
- The objective of this project is to perform image smoothing and image sharpening using a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter
- To implement template matching technique, i.e., normalized cross correlation (NCC) which detects a patch in an image

## K-means & Image Denoising
- The objective of this project is to segment image using k-means clustering
- The objective of this project is to denoise image using median filter
